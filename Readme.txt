Create a java project and create 2 java files in it. One for Interface OurQueue and the other for BoundedQueue.Copy the codes in the respective files.

Inputs and procedure to run the program:
Once you compile and execute(run) the code, the list is printed.
Firstly we have to input the maximum size of the queue as it is a bounded queue.
Then, we have to input the queue size in which we can add that number of element in one go.
Now there are 6 options - 1, 2, 3,4,5 and 6.
Entering 1 will ask for an element to be added at the rear of the list.
Entering 2 removes front element and prints that element.
Entering 3 will print the front element without deleting it.
Entering 4 will print the size of the queue.
Entering 5 will clear the queue.
Entering 6 will Convert it into an array and print it.
Now the updated list with the new elemnt is printed.
